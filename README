All java files are found within the src > test > java folder. 

The file used to generate data is 'GenerateData.py'. Once you run that, you will have to provide 
the file path to where that csv file was created. 

Run main to begin instructions. *You may have to remove the python file from the project directory for main to work if you are using intellij. 
Simply remove the file and then import a new intellij project with all the other java files. 

You will also probably need to download the jar dependency for apache-commons-csv and add it to your intellij dependencies.
